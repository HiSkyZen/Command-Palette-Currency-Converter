Convert fiat and crypto currencies without leaving [Command Palette](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/command-palette/overview). Type natural language, pin the pairs you care about, and keep live rates on the dock — ready the moment you open your launcher.

## Why you'll love it

- **Natural language** — codes, symbols, and mixed styles all work (`100 inr to usd`, `$100 to €`, `₽100`)
- **Fiat and crypto** — convert in either direction with the free default API
- **Math built in** — evaluate expressions with BODMAS/PEMDAS, then convert
- **Pins + dock** — save conversions and see live amounts on the Command Palette dock
- **Details at a glance** — unit rate, inverse rate, and when the rate was last updated
- **Aliases** — rich built-in currency symbols, plus your own custom aliases
- **Free by default** — unlimited daily rates with no API key required

## Installation

This extension supports both **x64** and **ARM** architectures for all installation methods below.

### Method 1: Microsoft Store

Install Currency Converter directly from the Microsoft Store. Click the badge below to open the store page:

[![Microsoft](https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20dark.svg)](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PC2T04G3V9C)

### Method 2: Winget

If you have [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (Windows Package Manager) installed, run:

```
winget install advaith.CurrencyConverterCommandPalette
```

### Method 3: MSIX from GitHub Releases

Download the MSIX package from the [Releases](https://github.com/advaith3600/Command-Palette-Currency-Converter/releases) page. Choose the file that matches your architecture (**x64** or **ARM**) and install it manually.

## Quick start

1. Open Command Palette and type a conversion on the home list (for example `300 cny` or `10*30`). The converted amount appears immediately.
2. Press **Enter** to copy the converted amount, or **Ctrl + Enter** and choose **Open Currency Converter**. You can also run **Currency Converter** and type there (for example `100 usd to eur`).
3. Press **Enter** on a result in the extension to copy the converted amount to the clipboard.
4. Open the details pane on a selected result to see the unit rate, inverse rate, and last update time.

## Usage

Type a conversion in natural language. Currency codes, symbols, and mixed styles all work:

```
100 inr to usd
eur 100 in usd

$100
100R$
100€
100₽
₹100
$100 to eur
100$ to euro
```

Conversion titles always show both source and target (for example `2 USD → 1.86 EUR`). Values use dynamic precision: when an amount is less than 1, the number of non-zero decimal places shown follows your system configuration.

On the Command Palette home list, a matching query shows one live conversion (the converted amount, not a loading ellipsis) with the subtitle **Currency Converter**:

- `300` or `10*30` — local currency → first Quick Conversion currency
- `300 cny` — that currency → local (or first Quick Conversion currency if it is already local)
- `300 cny to eur` — that pair

If local and first Quick Conversion currency are the same, a number-only query still appears as **Convert "300" with Currency Converter** so you can open the extension. Network or API errors on the home list use that same title by default (**Suppress fallback warnings**); turn the setting off to see the error instead. When a live conversion is shown, **Enter** copies the amount and **Ctrl + Enter** opens Currency Converter.

### Crypto and other currencies

Convert between fiat and cryptocurrencies in either direction. See the [full list of supported currencies](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies.json).

```
1 btc to usd
1000 usd to btc
```

### Quick conversions

Type just a number to convert from your local currency into the other currencies configured in Settings. You can change both the local currency and the list of target currencies there.

```
102.2
$1209
```

### Mathematical calculations

Type a math expression and the extension evaluates it with BODMAS/PEMDAS before converting. Supported operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, including brackets:

```
(12.4 - 34) / 3.3 + 43.3 * 2.22
```

## Pins & dock

Pin conversions you check often. They stay at the top of Currency Converter (when the search box is empty) and also appear on the Command Palette dock.

### Pin a conversion

1. Search a conversion, for example `34 btc to aed`.
2. Open the context menu (`Ctrl + Enter`) and choose **Pin**.
3. Open Currency Converter again with an empty search — your pins load at the top with live rates.

Pins briefly show **Loading…**, then the live amount (or **Loading failed** if the request fails). **Enter** still copies the converted amount; use the context menu (`Ctrl + Enter`) to **Unpin**.

### Currency pins on the dock

The same pins show up in the Command Palette **Currency pins** dock band, so favorite rates are visible without opening the extension.

- **Enter** copies the converted amount
- Context menu: **Refresh** rates for that pin's base currency, or **Unpin**
- Dock rates refresh automatically on a new local calendar day, and whenever you change your pins

## Aliases

Open **Manage currency aliases** to view, create, and remove currency aliases. Hundreds of built-in symbol aliases (`$`, `€`, `₹`, `£`, and more) ship with the extension so everyday typing just works.

You can also:

- **Export** your alias configuration to your Downloads folder
- **Reset** all aliases to the built-in defaults

Remove an alias by selecting it and pressing `Ctrl + Enter`, then confirming the prompt.

## Settings

Open Settings from the Currency Converter command (context menu → Settings).

| Setting                             | What it does                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quick Conversion Local Currency** | Base currency for number-only quick conversions            |
| **Quick Conversion Currencies**     | Comma-separated targets (e.g. `USD, EUR, BTC`)             |
| **Decimal format separator**        | System default, always dots, or always commas              |
| **Conversion Cache duration**       | How long rates stay cached, in hours (min `0.5`, max `24`) |
| **Conversion API**                  | Rate provider (see below)                                  |
| **Conversion API Key**              | Required for ExchangeRateAPI, CurrencyAPI, or Twelve Data   |
| **Suppress fallback warnings**      | On by default. Home-list conversion errors show **Convert "query" with Currency Converter** instead of a warning |
